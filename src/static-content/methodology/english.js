  paragraph1:
    "In early 2016, the GDHM team, together with representatives from 20+ countries and 50+ international agencies and organizations, designed version 1.0 of the Global Digital Health Index (GDHI).\n" +
    "        In 2022, the resource underwent a year-long indicator and platform review and redesign process to align the indicators with the WHO Global Digital Health Strategy as a complement to the WHO Digital Health Atlas and includes a greater focus on AI,\n" +
    "        equity, gender, and Universal Health Coverage. In addition, the name was changed to the Global Digital Health Monitor (GDHM) to articulate the tool’s value in providing a platform to monitor digital health progress at a country, regional and global level.\n" +
    "        The updated GDHM includes year on year performance monitoring country visualizations, regional visualizations, and country to country comparisons.",

      "Convened digital health experts to develop use cases for GDHM and refine and define an initial set\n" +

    "The GDHM team works with country partners and Ministry of Health representatives who are\n" +
    "        leading digital health efforts in their respective countries to collect data for each country.\n" +
    "        These country partners submit their country’s data through an annual GDHM survey,\n" +
    "        and select the appropriate phase for each indicator as well as rationale and evidence to support these phases.\n" +
    "        The GDHM team verifies the collected data before publishing it. Broader Health Data from the",

  title3: "Calculating Averages and Benchmarking",
  paragraph4:
    "The GDHM uses the main indicators in each category to calculate the overall country average.\n" +
    "        While sub-indicators are included to add greater specificity to specific GDHM indicators,\n" +
    "        they are not used in calculating the Component Phase or the Country or Global Averages.\n" +
    "        The GDHM enables countries to benchmark themselves against the Global Average or a specific overall phase.",

  title4: "Pre-populated data from publicly available sources",
  paragraph5:
    "For countries that have not completed a survey in the Global Digital Health Monitor, data was extracted from publicly available information to pre-populate the indicators below to give a general sense of broader digital ecosystem maturity in alignment with relevant indicators. While this data serves as a proxy for these digital health indicators for countries, data completed by government officials provide a more accurate and robust picture of the digital health progress in each country. We encourage countries that have not submitted full data to request a country link to do so at their earliest convenience.\n",
